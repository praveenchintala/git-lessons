.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:################################################################
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:published from being rewound.
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:The workflow assumed here is:
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample: * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:   merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample: * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:   it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:   the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample: * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:   branches, merge them into "next" branch.
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:With this workflow, you would want to know:
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:    not want to rewind it.
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:    build on top of it -- other people may already want to
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:    change things related to the topic as patches against your
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:    "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:    tip of "master".
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:Let's look at this example:
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:

.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:A, B and C are topic branches.
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample: * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample: * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:   and is ready to be deleted.
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample: * C has not merged to "next" at all.
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:
.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample:We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
